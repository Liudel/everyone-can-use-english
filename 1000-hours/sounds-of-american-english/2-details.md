# 2. 音素详解

理论上来讲，把每个音素读准本身其实并不难；更何况每种语言都一样，从音素的数量上来看并不是很多，比如英语，总计就那么四十几个而已。

In theory, pronouncing each phoneme correctly isn't really a hard nut to crack; plus, like any other language, English doesn’t have that many of them—just over forty in total.

主要的难点来自于两个方面。

However, there are two main challenges here.

首先是在连贯的自然语音中，几乎每个音素都有这样那样的变化。于是，我们只能通过反复阅读材料，反复练习，反复自我纠正，将起初看起来极为繁杂的知识点逐一突破。

Firstly, almost every single phoneme morphs here and there within fluent speech. So what can one do? The key lies within *repetition* – repeatedly read materials aloud, corrected by self-monitoring your pronunciation, focusing on those pesky shifting details until they become conquered hurdles rather than intimidating obstacles.

更大的困难来自于我们的大脑机制。随着年龄的增加，大脑会过滤母语中用不到的声音，以便提高语音识别的效率 —— 也恰恰是这一点造成了绝大多数成年人学外语的最大障碍。有些声音我们听不到、听不清楚，有些声音听到了却无法分辨，有些声音被我们自己在不知不觉中替换成了另外的样子…… 应对方式只有一个，集中注意力反复听，反复练 —— **注意力集中才是真正的关键**。

An even greater challenge stems from how our brain functions over time: as we age, our minds begin filtering out unnecessary sounds not present in native tongues as noises to enhance linguistic efficiency - which happens also to be a major obstacle for most adults learning foreign languages as some sounds go unheard or indistinct while others get mistakenly replaced unconsciously... The only weapon at hand? Again, *repetition* - repeately listen and practice, with full *attention*, which is another indispensbile key.
