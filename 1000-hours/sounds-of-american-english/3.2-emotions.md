# 3.2 情绪（Emotions）

学习语音的唯一有效方法只有模仿。在模仿的时候，最难模仿的，其实并不是我们已经讲解过的各种重点…… 还有一个可能无法模仿的，和另外一个其实可以模仿的。

The only effective way to learn speech is by *imitation*. The most challenging part of this process isn't necessarily the key points we've previously discussed... There are two things that may come to mind: one that might be impossible to mimic, and another that could actually be copied.

可能无法模仿的是对方的**音质**，因为到最后，每个人的声音都不一样，声线、音域、音量都不一样…… 通常来说，除非是模仿能力特别强的人，才能做到发出和别人同样音质的声音 —— 虽然不是谁都做不到，但，这个要求多少的确有点过份……

The thing that might be impossible to mimic is someone else's *voice quality*. In the end, each person's voice is unique - the pitch, range, and volume all differ. Usually, only those with a particularly strong ability to imitate can perfectly replicate the voice quality of another. While not impossible, this expectation can indeed be a bit excessive.

然而，的确有确实可以模仿的 —— **情绪**。紧张、兴奋、疲惫、失望、恐惧、悲伤、快乐、期待，等等等等。就算不能模仿得一模一样，终归能按照自己的方式去表现同样的情绪 —— 瞬间就能做到八九不离十。

However, there is something that can certainly be mimicked - *emotions*. Be it nervousness, excitement, fatigue, disappointment, fear, sadness, joy, anticipation, and so on. Even if you can't mimic these emotions identically, you can certainly express the same feelings in your own way - and instantly get pretty close to the mark.

用 AI 生成的真人语音，最大的问题在于，它目前还不能做到**情绪饱满**，它只是尽量做到了 “听起来像是真人说话”，虽然已经很好，但就是缺乏情绪表达 —— 它也的确没有什么真正的情绪……

The biggest issue with AI-generated human voices is that they currently lack emotional depth. They strive to *sound like a human speaking* and while they do this well, they fall short in conveying emotion - which is understandable, as they don't genuinely feel any emotions.

各种惊悚片动作片都很精彩，很吸引人…… 可实际上它们真的不是最好的学习材料，因为这类影视内容的对话事实上非常枯燥，警匪片里最常重复的，只不过是 *Freeze! Drop your gun!* 要么就是 *You have the right to remain silent*... 战争片里最常重复的更加迷离，反反复复最多的都是 *Get down!* 或者 *Go! Go! Go!* —— 动作太多，语言就只能太少。至于情绪么，往往更多的只有愤怒或者悲伤。

Action movies or thrillers may be captivating, but they are not the best study materials. The dialogues in these movies can be quite dry. Police dramas seem to endlessly repeat phrases like *Freeze! Drop your gun!* or *You have the right to remain silent*. In war movies, you'll frequently hear *Get down!* or *Go! Go! Go!* The abundance of action scenes leaves little room for language. As for emotions, only expressions of anger and sadness tend to dominate.

这就是为什么**生活情景剧**和**脱口秀**常常是很好的学习材料的重要原因 —— 主要是情绪丰富且饱满。另外，**纪录片**往往都是很好的学习材料。它们的特点是，措辞简单明了，语速慢，吐字清晰，并且情绪饱满。情绪更加饱满的，是各种给青少年甚至婴幼儿看的动画片或者绘本讲解，情绪丰富饱满到夸张的地步……

That's why *sitcoms* and *talk shows* often make great learning resources. They are rich in emotional content. *Documentaries* can also serve as excellent study materials, which feature simple and clear wording, slow speech, clear articulation, and full emotions. Even more emotionally expressive are *shows and storybooks for teenagers and toddlers*, where emotions are exaggerated to the extreme.

如果觉得这些都太尴尬，还有个办法是不断学唱**英文歌曲** —— 每个音节都带着不同的音高曲调，甚至有可能一个词就唱了满满一两个小节，容不得一丝的错误，真的是绝佳的练习场景。

If you find these a bit awkward, another approach is to continuously learn English *songs*. Each syllable carries a different tone or melody, and a single word could fill a couple of bars, leaving no room for errors. It's indeed an excellent practice setting.

语音的功用，如果说有 *20%* 是用来传递对事实的感受的话，那么，剩下的 *80%* 肯定并且只能用来传递情绪，不是吗？一直以来，大家在 “学外语” 的时候，都太理智了，不是吗？理智的确是一种很好的品质，但，有时候，它可能会成为不可逾越的障碍…… 真的很可惜！

If we say that *20%* of voice utility is for conveying feelings towards *facts*, then the remaining *80%* must be intended to express *emotions*, right? Perhaps we've been too logical when learning foreign languages, haven't we? While rationality is a good trait, it can sometimes turn into an insurmountable hurdle... which is truly a pity!
