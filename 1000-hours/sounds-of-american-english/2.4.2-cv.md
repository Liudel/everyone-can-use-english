# 2.4.2 辅音 + 元音（Consonant + Vowel）

在词汇内部，“辅音 + 元音” 当然可以构成一个音节；在同一个**意群**（thought group）中，如果**以辅音结尾的词汇**遇到**以元音开头的词汇**的话，那么前一个词末尾的**辅音**和后一个词开头的**元音**很可能会连起来读，听起来构成一个**音节**，这种方式叫做**连读**。

A syllable can be formed by a "consonant + vowel" combination within a word. Within the same *thought group*, if a word *ending in a consonant* meets a word *beginning with a vowel*, the final consonant of the first word and the initial vowel of the second word *may well* blend together when spoken, sounding as if they form a single *syllable*, which is often referred to as *linking*.

比如在 *People's opinions vary from individual to individual.*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/sentence-opinions-vary-alloy.mp3" data-audio-us-female="/audios/us/sentence-opinions-vary-nova.mp3"></span> 在这句话中，*People's* 末尾的 <span class="pho">z</span> 和 *opinions* 开头的 <span class="pho">ə</span> 会连在一起，<span class="pho alt">piː·pəl·zə·ˈpɪ·njənz</span> —— 感觉上是在读一整个由 *5* 个音节构成的词汇一样……

For instance, when saying *People's opinions vary from individual to individual*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/sentence-opinions-vary-alloy.mp3" data-audio-us-female="/audios/us/sentence-opinions-vary-nova.mp3"></span>, the <span class="pho">s</span> at the end of *People's* and the <span class="pho">ə</span> at the start of *opinions* seamlessly connect, making it sound like a five-syllable word: /pi-pəl-zə-ˈpɪ-njənz/. It feels as if you're pronouncing a single, lengthy word.

这类**连读**中有相当难度乃至于必须刻意练习的其实只有两种，<span class="pho">t</span> 和 <span class="pho">l</span> 构成的连读。

There are two particular types which are quite challenging and require deliberate practice. These involve the use of <span class="pho">t</span> and <span class="pho">l</span>, respectively.

之前提到过，在美式英语里，<span class="pho">t</span> 有个特殊的现象，它夹在两个元音之间的时候会被浊化，被读成弹舌音，用 <span class="pho">t̬</span> 表示，听起来接近 <span class="pho">d</span>…… 比如，在 city <span class="pho alt">ˈsɪt̬i</span><span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/city-us-male.mp3" data-audio-us-female="/audios/us/city-us-female.mp3"></span> 这个词汇里， <span class="pho">t</span> 就夹在两个元音之间。

It is previously mentioned that in American English, the <span class="pho">t</span> sound has a unique characteristic. When it's sandwiched between two vowels, it's often voiced with an *alveolar flapping*, creating a sound very close to <span class="pho">d</span>. This is represented as <span class="pho">t̬</span>. For example, in the word *city* <span class="pho">/ˈsɪt̬i</span>/<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/city-us-male.mp3" data-audio-us-female="/audios/us/city-us-female.mp3"></span>, the <span class="pho">t</span> is between two vowels.

在自然语流里，同一个意群中，经常会出现以 <span class="pho">t</span> 结尾的词汇后面跟着一个以元音开头的词汇，并且，<span class="pho">t</span> 的前面是元音的概率也很高，所以，词汇之间出现 <span class="pho">t</span> 的浊化弹舌音 <span class="pho">t̬</span> 的情况非常普遍。比如，*Get it done.* <span class="pho alt">ɡet̬ ɪt dʌn</span><span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/sentence-it-done-alloy.mp3" data-audio-us-female="/audios/us/sentence-it-done-nova.mp3"></span>

In natural speech flow, it's common to find a word ending with <span class="pho">t</span> closely followed by a word beginning with a vowel within the same thought group. Furthermore, there's a high possibility that the <span class="pho">t</span> is preceded by a vowel. Therefore, the occurrence of the flapped <span class="pho">t̬</span> between words is incredibly prevalent. For example: *Get it done.* <span class="pho alt">ɡet̬ ɪt dʌn</span><span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/sentence-it-done-alloy.mp3" data-audio-us-female="/audios/us/sentence-it-done-nova.mp3"></span>

<span class="pho">l</span> 构成的连读，对绝大多数人来说，难点在于，如果前一个单词末尾的 <span class="pho">l</span> **舌尖动作不够完整**的话（即，结束的时候舌尖没有贴到龈脊）那么，<span class="pho">l</span> 这个弹舌音就发不出来，无法与后面的元音连上…… 尤其是在没有纠正掉用嘴唇动作替代舌尖动作的错误（乃至于有 <span class="pho">ʊ</span> 的音色）的情况下。

The challenge of linked speech involving <span class="pho">l</span> lies in the tongue's movement. If the tip of the tongue does not make complete contact with the roof of the mouth at the end of a word ending in <span class="pho">l</span>, it's difficult to produce the appropriate sound for the subsequent flapping <span class="pho">l</span> with the following vowel. This is especially true if the habit of substituting the movement of the lips for the action of the tongue hasn't been corrected, leading to a sound colored by <span class="pho">ʊ</span>.

请仔细听一遍以下的录音，注意所有以 <span class="pho">l</span> 作为末尾的音节：

Please listen carefully to the following recording, pay special attention to words ending with <span class="pho">l</span>:

> Whether the *goal of* an insurgency has been to establish the Christian religion in the days of the Roman Empire, to create an interstate commerce commission in nineteenth-century America, or to promote civil rights for minorities in the twentieth century, what a *successful insurgency* does in *institutional or* process terms is to change the incentives and constraints facing others, as well as the incentives and constraints facing themselves and their successors.<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/goal-of.mp3"></span>[^1]

在以上这段录音中，*goal~of*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/goal-of-1.mp3"></span>, *successful~insurgency*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/goal-of-2.mp3"></span>, *as well~as*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/goal-of-3.mp3"></span>, 都有前一个单词末尾的 <span class="pho">l</span> 与后一个单词开头的元音之间轻微的连读。但，*institutional or*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/goal-of-4.mp3"></span> 之间却没有 —— 因为这两个词汇实际上分别属于前后不同的意群。

In the audio clip above, the phrase *goal~of*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/goal-of-1.mp3"></span>, *successful~insurgency*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/goal-of-2.mp3"></span>, and *as well~as*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/goal-of-3.mp3"></span> all exhibit slight linking between the ending <span class="pho">l</span> of the first word and the vowel at the beginning of the following word. However, there's no such linking between *institutional* and *or*<span class="speak-word-inline" data-audio-us-male="/audios/us/goal-of-4.mp3"></span>. That's because these two words belong to separate thought groups.

初学者容易矫枉过正，想把一切自己遇到的词汇间 “辅音 + 元音” 的组合连起来读…… 请注意，是**很可能**连起来读，但**并不一定**。首先，这多少与个人讲话的习惯有关。更为重要的是，讲话的时候要划分**意群**，意群之间要有**暂停**（*pause*）—— 前一个意群末尾的辅音和下一个意群开头的元音，不应该连读。

Beginners often overcorrect when learning English, trying to merge all "consonant + vowel" combinations they encounter. Remember, it's *possible* to connect sounds, but it's not always *necessary*. This largely depends on personal speaking habits. More importantly, when speaking, one should divide their speech into *thought groups*, pausing between each group. Do not blend the ending consonant of one thought group with the beginning vowel of the next.

> 目前（2024.03） OpenAI 的 TTS 引擎生成的语音中，*<span class="pho">l</span> + vowels* 的组合总是没有连读效果 —— 也许将来的版本会改进？

> As of now (March 2024), the TTS engine from OpenAI doesn't seem to blend the sound of ending <span class="pho">l</span> with following vowels smoothly. But who knows? Future versions might just improve on this.
